ActisoftR: to do list

# 07/08/2017 #ESF
Implement quality control procedure for acti_data:
- check that the SLEEP periods are contained within REST periods. Provide warning and solution
- check for overlapping of periods that should be mutually exclusive. e.g. ACTIVE and REST
- if any period end < start, then reverse them and provide a warning.
- look for patterns in the plots.

Implement a random generation of SLEEP/REST and possibly WORK periods. Setting number of days, participants, etc.
