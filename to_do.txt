ActisoftR: to do list 

# 07/08/2017 #ESF 
Implement quality control procedure for acti_data:
- check that the SLEEP periods are contained within REST periods. Provide warning and solution
- check for overlapping of periods.
- if a period end < start, then reverse them.

Implement a random generation of SLEEP/REST and possibly WORK periods. Setting number of days, participants, etc. 

Implement other metrics e.g. sleep onset latency.

Include real datasets. Look in the the literature.
